# Low-Light-Image-Enhancement-using-Zero-Reference-Deep-Curve-Estimations
Enhances low-light images and video using Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation (Zero-DCE). A lightweight CNN estimates pixel-wise curves for dynamic range adjustment without reference images, using non-reference loss functions to improve brightness, preserve detail, and reduce color distortion.
